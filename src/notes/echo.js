        + 'the repeats a guess is marked against, and the tail lands exactly where the '
        + 'setting says rather than being retimed under a playhead.\n\n'

        + 'A dotted eighth and a quarter-note triplet are only twelve per cent apart. That '
        + 'is a difference you can measure and it is not one anybody names by ear, so '
