// Saturation: what a signal comes out as when the thing it went through was
// not quite a straight line.
//
// Every other tool in this app moves energy that was already there. An EQ
// turns a band up, a compressor turns a moment down, a reverb and a delay put
// copies of it somewhere else, an imager moves it across the room. A
// nonlinearity is the only one that makes energy at frequencies that were
// never in the input - and that is the entire subject. Feed it 220 Hz and out
// come 440, 660, 880 and so on, and the recipe of that series is what people
// are hearing when they say warm, or edgy, or crunchy, or broken.
//
// The two things that decide the recipe:
//
//   Bias - whether the curve treats up and down the same. A symmetric curve
//   can only make odd harmonics: the third, the fifth, the seventh. Tilt it
//   so one half squashes before the other and the even harmonics appear -
//   the second, the fourth - and those are the ones that sound like an
//   octave rather than like distortion. Even is warm; odd is dirty. That
//   single fact is most of what an ear needs here.
//
//   Hardness - how abruptly the curve gives up, which decides when the
//   colour arrives rather than how much of it there is. Measured: at a
//   moderate drive a soft curve is already making a third harmonic while a
//   hard one is still doing nothing at all, and at a high drive it is the
//   other way round - the hard curve is a square wave, with a series running
//   all the way up, and the soft one is still mostly a third and a fifth. A
//   soft curve is always a little coloured; a hard one is clean until it
//   isn't, and then it is everything at once.
