// Its own file, and it has to be. The envelope in `src/read.js` is what every
// DSP module imports to wrap its measurement; the comparators live in those
// same DSP modules, beside the maths they compare. So a single file holding
// both the envelope and the dispatch imports the modules that import it - a
// cycle, which the bundler's module order refuses outright and which would
// otherwise have surfaced as a page whose every control came up empty.
//
// Nothing in the app needs this yet: every exercise knows which kind of
// reading it is marking and calls that comparator directly. What needs it is
// anything holding two readings it did not produce - a chain report, a
// comparison against a reference, a drill that asks which of three is closest.
