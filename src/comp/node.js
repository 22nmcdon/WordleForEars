 * channels in, the signal on the left and the key on the right, one out, and
 * the deepest reduction since anybody last looked.
 *
 * A ScriptProcessor stands behind it. AudioWorklet needs a module loaded from
 * a URL, and this page is published as a single file that may be served under
 * a policy that will not have one; the fallback is deprecated and runs on the
 * main thread, and it is still a working compressor where the good path is
