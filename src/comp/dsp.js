// be fed a sidechain, has no RMS detector and no lookahead, its release curve
// is not the one written on it, and it applies a makeup gain of its own that
// lives in the implementation rather than in the arithmetic - which the old
// version of this mode had to measure on a grid and cancel by hand. A mode
// whose subject is compression cannot be built on a box whose behaviour has to
// be reverse-engineered.
//
// So: one detector, one static curve, one smoother, written out. The same
// code runs in three places - the worklet that makes the sound, the scoring
// that reads a guess, and the tests - which is the only way the three can be
// held to agree.
//
// Everything here is self-contained on purpose. `src/comp/node.js` builds the
// worklet by stringifying these functions, so none of them may close over
// anything outside its own body.
