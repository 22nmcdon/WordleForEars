// What a compressor's settings do to a piece of audio, in an envelope.
//
// Its own file, and the only kind of reading that has one. `comp/dsp.js`
// promises that every function in it closes over nothing outside its own body,
// because `comp/node.js` stringifies five of them and hands them to the audio
// thread - a function that quietly referenced an import would fail there and
// nowhere else. That promise is worth more than the symmetry of putting this
// beside the maths, so this sits next door instead.
//
// The audit that produced the reading contract found one thing here that the
// other five tools do not have: the compressor's display reading and its
// scoring reading are different types. The display wants gain reduction per
// sample - a quarter of a million numbers, drawn as a trace. The scorer wants
// it framed at five milliseconds, because a single sample of disagreement on a
// transient is not a wrong answer. Both were being called "the reading".
//
// So the reading is the framed one, and the per-sample trace stays what it
// always was: a detail the player keeps for the display. Without that split,
// composing a chain report out of these would inherit a 240,000-element array
// and a shape nothing else in the app has.
