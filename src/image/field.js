// What stereo width is, for somebody using an imager, is in
// src/notes/image.js.
//
// Everything an imager does comes down to one identity: a pair of channels is
// the same information as a middle and a side, M = (L+R)/2 and S = (L-R)/2,
// and you can go back the other way whenever you like. Turning S up is what
// "wider" means. Turning it down to nothing is mono.
//
// The interesting part is doing it per band, because the low end and the top
// want opposite things. A bass spread across the field sounds big and then
// disappears the moment anybody sums it to mono, and a top end left in the
// middle sounds like a phone call. So: three bands, two crossovers you can
// move, and a width on each.

// of this source, so nothing here may close over anything outside its body.
