/**
 * The EQ, as a thing you open rather than a question you are asked.
 *
 * This half used to be a `mount(el, { puzzle })` inside the exercise, which
 * meant a tool could not exist without a round to justify it - and that a
 * change of exercise tore the plugin down, stopped the audio, and built
 * another one. Here the tool knows nothing about a puzzle, an answer or a
 * tier. It opens, it runs, and an exercise is something that arrives later.
 *
 * What is left of the old mode in this file is the part that is true of the
 * EQ whatever you are doing with it: what it is called, what it is for, and
 * how to work it. The exercises are in src/work/eq.js and the long prose is
 * in src/notes/eq.js.
