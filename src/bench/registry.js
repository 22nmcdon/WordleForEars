// What a tool is, put back together.
//
// Each of the six is now three files: what it is and how to open it in
// src/tools, what you do with it in src/work, and the long prose in
// src/notes. Something has to say those three are the EQ, and this is it.
//
// The split is not tidiness. A tool that knows about answers cannot be opened
// without a round, which is what made changing an exercise a teardown; an
// exercise that knows about canvases cannot be tested without a browser,
// which is why the lifecycle had never been tested at all. Keeping them apart
// is what lets one tool outlive many exercises and lets the decisions between
// them be checked headless.
