// Putting an exercise on a tool, and taking it back off.
//
// The inversion, in one file. Until now an exercise mounted a plugin and the
// plugin was destroyed when the exercise changed - so changing the dropdown
// tore the tool down, stopped the audio, and built a new one. That is the
// wrong way round for a workbench: the tool is the thing you are working at,
// and an exercise is something that arrives, sets it up, and leaves.
//
// Everything here is decisions rather than drawing. There are no DOM classes
// below this line and no canvas; what a tool is, as far as this is concerned,
// is the dozen methods in the contract. That is deliberate - it means the
// order things happen in, what is restored, and what happens when material
// never arrives can all be tested headless against a tool made of nothing but
// promises, which is where the awkward cases actually live.
//
// The risk this was written for: `destroy()` has run before every mount this
// app has ever done, so no plugin has ever had to survive a state change.
// `lock()` had no inverse until a stage ago, `showTarget` left a ghost drawn
// over the next exercise, and `setTarget(null)` had never been called by
// anybody - the EQ's would have walked null as an array. Attaching twice in a
// row exercises all of it.

/**
 * What a tool was doing before an exercise arrived.
 *
 * Not whether it is playing: nothing in an attach stops the audio, which is
 * the whole point of the inversion - the loop keeps running and a new exercise
 * is a crossfade rather than a stop. And `playing` on these plugins is a
 * setter, so calling it to ask would answer by turning the sound off.
