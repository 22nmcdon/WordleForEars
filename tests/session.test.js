/**
 * A tool made of nothing but promises.
 *
 * The plan called this the most valuable new test artefact here, and the
 * reason is the risk it covers. `destroy()` has run before every mount this
 * app has ever done, so no plugin has ever had to survive a state change:
 * `lock()` had no inverse until two stages ago, `showTarget` left a ghost
 * drawn over whatever came next, and `setTarget(null)` had never been called
 * by anybody - the EQ's would have walked null as an array.
 *
 * All of that is lifecycle rather than drawing, and there are 167 tests in
 * this project that touch no DOM. So the decisions moved into `session.js`
 * and this stands in for a plugin: it records every call in order, so what is
 * asserted is not only the end state but the sequence that got there.
